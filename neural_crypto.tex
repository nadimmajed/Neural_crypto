1-experiment
look for the optimal parameters to train XOR
mean = 0,mean = 0.5,stddev = sqrt(0.1),stddev =1
hidden units (2,3,4,5)
activation function (relu, sigmoid)
with or without bias


2-experiment
train not( XOR)
activation function 1 = relu, activation function 2 = sigmoid 
mean = 0,mean = 0.5,stddev = sqrt(0.1),stddev =1
hidden units (2,3,4,5)
with or without bias

3-experiment
train 2 bit XOR bit by bit (key in ((0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1))
activation function 1 = relu, activation function 2 = sigmoid 
mean = 0,mean = 0.5,stddev = sqrt(0.1),stddev =1
hidden units (2,3,4,5)
with or without bias

4-experiemnt


4bit_10seed and 8bit_10 seed:
training a neural network to encrypt  a 4 and 8 bit message. 
calculate the average and the standard deviation of the accuracy for 10 different seeds 
(2,4,8) hidden layers
activation function 1 = relu, activation function 2 = sigmoid 
mean = 0,mean = 0.5,stddev = sqrt(0.1),stddev =1
with or without bias


8bit_10 seed:
